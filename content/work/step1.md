Does your service support federated authentication? In all cases, your service needs to be enabled with federated authentication. If a user can already sign into your site using their institution's sign in credentials, you may be able to simply configure your service to use SeamlessAccess.


# 1. Gather information and make a plan

---

> **Who does this work?** This information will be gathered from several different people and probably will be coordinated by a project manager. During this phase of the work, you will be working closely with the SeamlessAccess team who will help you interpret the information you have gathered and what it means to your organization. Based on this information, we will also be able to estimate time and resource requirements to make your site SeamlessAccess enabled.

You may not know how you are currently using federated authentication! So, your task will be in determining who in your organization to ask. Often those who handle system security compliance will know, as will those who manage the access control to the resources that are secured by a sign in.

## If users can already sign in with their institution

If users can already sign into your service, you likely are already using a tool to make these connections. You will need to learn these tools are. In [Step 3. Implement the service](/step3), we include instructions for connecting common tools such as Shibboleth and SimpleSAMLphp.

## If you are not yet set up with federated authentication

Maybe you are just getting started with federated sign on! Weâ€™re excited that you are trying it out with SeamlessAccess so that your end users get the best possible user experience. For you, we suggest using Shibboleth SP, and we include in this guide details on how to get it up and running.
