SeamlessAccess.org is a service designed to help foster a more streamlined online access experience when using scholarly collaboration tools, information resources, and shared research infrastructure. The service promotes digital authentication leveraging an existing single-sign-on infrastructure through one’s home institution, while maintaining an environment that protects personal data and privacy.
SeamlessAccess.org aims to enable simple, trusted use of scholarly resources and services anytime, anywhere, and on any device.

Governance of this service is through the Coalition for Seamless Access, a collaboration between five organizations–[GÉANT](https://geant.org), [Internet2](https://internet2.edu), the [National Information Standards Organization](https://niso.org) (NISO), [ORCID](https://orcid.org), and the [International Association of STM Publishers](https://stm-assoc.org) (STM). Each organization participating on the governance committee offers either financial or in-kind support for the operation of the service.
