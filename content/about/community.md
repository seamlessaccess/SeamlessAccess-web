The SeamlessAccess community consists of individuals representing libraries, university IT, researchers, publishers, research collaborations, identity & access federations, and others that support and contribute to  scholarly creation. These individuals contribute to working groups that guide our work. We will be using this page to feature their contributions and inspire you to get involved.

# Entity Categories and Attribute Bundles Working Group
The purpose of this working group is to define and promote a set of attribute release profiles and associated entity categories applicable to the access of scholarly information resources and services in the context of federated authentication. 

The goal is to have these categorizations and profiles adopted and/or endorsed by global research and education federations, library communities, and other stakeholder groups. Any specific proposals for new entity categories should be submitted to REFEDS for consideration.

# Contract Language Working Group
The purpose of this working group is to define and promote language that 
may be used in contracts that include provisions for Federated Access. 
Typically, these contracts involve the library organization's Identity 
Provider Operator (IdP Operator) and electronic resources management staff 
as well as the Service Provider Operator (SP Operator) of the content or 
resource supplier. These provisions will hold both the Licensing Institution 
and the Resource Provider responsible for adherence to the Attribute Release 
Entity Categories applicable to the access of scholarly information resources 
and services in the context of federated authentication. The Technical Steering 
committee and the larger Seamless Access process have produced a technical 
infrastructure that is able to protect end user privacy; this group will 
endeavor to ensure those protections are maintained via contractual means.
