# REFEDS Entity Categories


The REFEDS community is currently working through existing Entity Categories, two of which having been originally proposed by the SeamlessAccess Entity Category Working Group, to bring them up to the necessary precision for this type of specification. These specifications must be very specific and targeted in scope, describing exactly what data attributes are to be released when these Entity Categories are used. The question of how and when a service provider should use these attributes, however, is out of scope for a specification.

Entity Categories are important because they make the process of attribute release much easier to manage. They help match the data and privacy requirements of the Identity Provider with the requirements of the service itself. They also allow administrators of identity management systems to have easy-to-use configuration guidance that supports appropriate information sharing between parties. Entity Categories also offer business units within the institution the opportunity to refer to these  descriptions in their contractual language with Service Providers.

All changes ultimately must be approved by the community. If you would like to stay abreast of public consultation announcements for these and other REFEDS specifications, please join the REFEDS [consultation mailing list](https://lists.refeds.org/sympa/info/consultations).



# Approach towards refreshing local browser storage


We are happy to announce that, with the next release, SeamlessAccess’ central discovery service will start to refresh information kept in the user’s browser local store.

SeamlessAccess is all about making the login experience as intuitive, easy, fast and stable as possible. To realize this, SeamlessAccess maintains a searchable database of metadata about Identity Providers (IdP’s), and stores that metadata for often-used IdP’s in the user’s browser local storage. Thanks to this persistence mechanism, SeamlessAccess can display the user’s IdP preferences without having to communicate with a central infrastructure - making the system both robust and fast.

While information about IdP’s does not change very often, changes do occasionally occur and SeamlessAccess has been working on  a way to keep this information up to date. Because of the distributed nature of how metadata is stored in each browser, this is actually not a straightforward problem for SeamlessAccess to solve!

The next release will offer a first step towards solving this challenge. In future releases, we will also start to clear out IdP metadata that cannot be refreshed or that has been deleted from the metadata service. We will be working with advanced integrators to plan for this change in order to make sure users are not affected in a negative way.
