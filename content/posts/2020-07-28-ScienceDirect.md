ScienceDirect integrates SeamlessAccess to provide improved remote access options for researchers

We are happy to announce that [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/), [Elsevier’s](http://www.elsevier.com/) large platform of peer-reviewed scholarly literature, is the latest service provider to go live with SeamlessAccess. 

Researchers will now see the SeamlessAccess ‘Access through your institution’ button clearly marked on ScienceDirect article pages. When they click on the button, if their institution has an authorized subscription to ScienceDirect, they are authenticated by their institution and can use ScienceDirect services in the usual way. Elsevier expects that this will provide researchers with more convenient and secure institutional access to its site, anytime, anywhere, and on any device.

ScienceDirect joins the increasing number of [services which have implemented SeamlessAccess](https://seamlessaccess.org/services/for-service-providers/). By providing a consistent user experience via the SeamlessAccess button across multiple services, we hope to increase user understanding and smooth access to the critical information resources researchers need at a time when their work is more important than ever.

“The impact of coronavirus means the ability to easily work from home is now more important than ever for researchers around the world. The integration of SeamlessAccess on ScienceDirect provides a way for researchers to be able to do this effortlessly on our platform, safe in the knowledge that they are doing this securely, and that their privacy and data is protected. ScienceDirect is the biggest integrator of SeamlessAccess so far, and we look forward to having more publishers and electronic resource owners integrate the service so that we can collectively improve the access experience to many more resources for the research community,” said Gaby Appleton, Managing Director Researcher Products, Elsevier.
