# Maintenance


SeamlessAccess has scheduled maintenance on:
 
**April 4, 2022 8:00AM - 12:00PM UTC**
 
We have booked a four-hour maintenance window to upgrade SeamlessAccess to [version 1.6.2](https://thiss-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releasenotes.html#version-1-6-2). We expect that end-users will not experience any interruptions during this maintenance window, however it is possible that there may be some caching issues. 

Please refer to the SeamlessAccess status page for more details: [https://status.seamlessaccess.org/](https://status.seamlessaccess.org/)
