# ALA committee on Federated Authentication


Core, a division of the American Library Association, has created a new [Federated Authentication Committee](https://www.ala.org/core/member-center/sections/technology/federated-authentication-committee) that will focus the library community’s efforts in understanding, evaluating, and implementing federated authentication as an access mechanism for library resources. Part of the responsibilities of this committee will be to assign a member to be a liaison to the SeamlessAccess governance committee and be a voice for the library community in the broader federated authentication conversation.

We at SeamlessAccess are very excited about having additional library voices as a part of our work. 





# SeamlessAccess 1.6.2 in Beta

Back in the fall of last year, we called on your help for translations to make SeamlessAccess available in multiple languages - something that we feel is very important given our focus on usability and the diverse, international user base that we serve. Translations are still very welcome if you’d like to contribute to the project in this way (for instructions on how to do that, see our [October](https://seamlessaccess.org/posts/2021-11-06-oct2021newsletter/) newsletter).

**We’re delighted to announce now that SeamlessAccess 1.6.2, including internationalization, is available in Beta. We kindly ask you to test the release at [https://use.thiss.io/](https://use.thiss.io/), and let us know if you encounter any problems or issues via [GitHub](https://github.com/TheIdentitySelector/thiss-js).**

For more detail, please see the [release notes](https://thiss-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releasenotes.html#version-1-6-2).


# Wolters Kluwer and Mark Allen Group implement SeamlessAccess

We’re thrilled to announce that two more publishers have integrated with SeamlessAccess this month.

Wolters Kluwer have integrated SeamlessAccess on their OVID platform, giving a prominent place to the SeamlessAccess button in the [top-right of the article landing page](https://oce.ovid.com/journals/aaprac/202203000/02054229-202203000-00001). _“Wolters Kluwer is excited to now provide our customers with the opportunity for a simplified login experience through SeamlessAccess. Starting on March 1 we’ve made authentication and access easier for our Ovid journals experience users as a pilot for the WK organization. We look forward to implementing SeamlessAccess within other products in the future.”_, says Nicole Caputo, Senior Product Manager, Ovid.

Mark Allen group, a family-owned, independent media communication company, have completed an advanced integration with the support of their platform host Atypon. _“Mark Allen is delighted to have integrated SeamlessAccess into our [MAG Online Library site](https://www.magonlinelibrary.com). Ease of access is vital for our diverse audiences, so enabling SeamlessAccess on the site promises to be a significant step forward.”_, says Tom Pollard, Product Director, Digital Resources at Mark Allen Group.

We are delighted to have these organizations on board and expect other publishers to join soon!
