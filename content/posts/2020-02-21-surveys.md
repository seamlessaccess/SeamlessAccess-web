SeamlessAccess intends to improve the way people from universities and colleges around the globe access content and services. To better understand the diverse situation in these institutions we have constructed two short surveys, available till *March 27th 2020*:

- [One for people working in libraries in universities/colleges](https://bostoncollege.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0Cbp6fmldW3iLFb)
- [One for people working in IT in universities and colleges](https://bostoncollege.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0Vv0iXWMLZMd9VH)

Please either fill out the survey or forward it to mailing lists, websites, or other forums followed by people working in academic libraries or IT.
