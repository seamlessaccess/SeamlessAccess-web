# Maintenance


SeamlessAccess has planned maintenance on:
 
**March 29, 2022 8:00AM - 12:00PM UTC**
 
We have booked a four-hour maintenance window to move the front-end service from GitHub Pages to a new infrastructure. The team will try to make sure that end-users won't experience any issues during the maintenance, however it is possible that, at moments during this time window, the service is temporarily unavailable.

Please refer to the SeamlessAccess status page for more details: [https://status.seamlessaccess.org/](https://status.seamlessaccess.org/)
