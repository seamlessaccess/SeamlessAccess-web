# Extending the benefits of SeamlessAccess to a new audience

SeamlessAccess hit an important milestone recently with the addition of our most recent service provider, The HistoryMakers.

While over the last years we've seen growing traction with global publishers of science, technical and medical content, the benefits of more seamless access are just as relevant and important to the broader community.

The HistoryMakers is a non-profit research and educational institution committed to preserving and making widely accessible the untold personal stories of both well-known and unsung African Americans.  SeamlessAccess makes it easier than ever for students, educators and researchers to access The HistoryMakers Digital Archive, an internationally recognized archival collection of thousands of African American video oral histories.

The addition of The HistoryMakers also marks a valuable new use case for SeamlessAccess, with a user’s stored organisational affiliation used to streamline library card authentication in addition to federated authentication.  This extends the benefits of SeamlessAccess outside traditional academic communities to a broader range of library users around the world.

_“Simplifying access is essential to our mission of making the HistoryMakers Digital Archive accessible to researchers and educators.  By removing barriers to access, SeamlessAccess helps us showcase the breadth and depth of the accomplishments of individual African Americans”_, said Julieanna Richardson, Founder and President of The HistoryMakers.
