which the Beta version of the SeamlessAccess.org Service is made

authentication procedures for access to their online platforms, that
constitutes a binding agreement between SeamlessAccess.org and the
Integrator.

The definition of terms defined in the singular shall include the
plural, and the definition of terms in the plural shall include the
singular, except where the context indicates otherwise.

# 3. Service:

The Service supports the streamlined authentication of Users by their
respective Identity Providers enabling those Users’ access to
resources of Service Providers, such as scholarly collaboration tools,
information resources, and shared research infrastructure. The Service
promotes digital authentication leveraging an existing single-sign-on
infrastructure provided by identity federations originating with the
Identity Provider that authenticates the User by means of the
Persistence Service and the Discovery Service.

The Persistence Service is a mechanism that allows the User’s browser
to save information about their preferred Identity Providers in
respect of each device for which the User selects the Service, in a
manner that permits redirection to the User’s Identity Provider’s
login pages for the purpose of authentication.

The Discovery Service is an optional mechanism that can be integrated
by Integrators to facilitate discovery of the User’s preferred
Identity Provider, which then stores the information about the User’s
Identity Provider into the Persistence Service.

The Service is available to be integrated in three versions, namely
Limited, Standard and Advanced, as detailed and updated from time to
time in the SeamlessAccess Documentation website at
[<u>hhttps://seamlessaccess.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCUMENTAT/overview</u>](https://seamlessaccess.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCUMENTAT/overview).
Advanced integration of the Service allows the Integrator to set up
its own Discovery Services and to use a Persistence Service API as
approved by SeamlessAccess.org.

The software that supports the Service and that an Integrator
integrates into its digital authentication procedures is open source,
available at https://github.com/TheIdentitySelector/thiss-js.
SeamlessAccess.org and the Integrator are entitled to use this
software, but it is not part of intellectual property owned by
SeamlessAccess.org and not a subject of this agreement.

The Service is a Beta version that is undergoing trial use to ensure
its stability, functionality, security, usability, broad
applicability, and fitness for purpose. Integrators are therefore
requested to notify SeamlessAccess.org of any faults in the operation
of the Service, as further detailed in respect of the Integrator in
clause 6.

# 4. Licence of Service and Related Trademarks:
    
4.1. By its activation of the Service for the Integrator following
the Integrator’s acceptance of these Terms of Service,
SeamlessAccess.org grants the Integrator and its affiliated
entities that are under common control the non-exclusive and
non-transferable licence to use the Service for the purpose
only of facilitating authentication of the User by their
Identity Provider, as meant in the description of the Service
in clause 3, and subject to these Terms of Service.
    
4.2. In order to have the Service activated, the Integrator must
have integrated the Service into its digital authentication
procedures by following the instructions in the Integration
Guide linked from the SeamlessAccess.org Documentation website at
[<u>https://seamlessaccess.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCUMENTAT/overview</u>](https://seamlessaccess.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCUMENTAT/overview)
and the software documentation at
[<u>https://thiss.io/integration/</u>](https://thiss.io/integration/).
    
4.3. **Standard and Advanced integration of the Service only**:
When the Integrator makes the Standard version or the Advanced
version of the Service available on its online platform(s), it
must do so by way of displaying the Button in the manner set
out in the Integration Guide. 
Integrator agrees to a UX review by SeamlessAccess staff before deploying SeamlessAccess into their production environment. The UX review needs to be happen in a timely fashion so that potential deviations from the Integration Guide can be approved. 
With the licence of the Service,
SeamlessAccess.org hereby grants the Integrator a
non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the Mark only
for the purpose of displaying the Button, subject to these
Terms of Service.

**Limited integration of the Service**: The licence in the above
provisions of this clause 4.3 does not extend to the use of the
Limited version of the Service. An Integrator integrating the Limited
version of the Service may not use the Button or the Trademark.

# 5. Term and Termination:
    
5.1. The Beta trial of the Service will come to an end 30 days
after SeamlessAccess.org notifies all Integrators directly
where possible and by notice on the SeamlessAccess.org website at
[<u>https://seamlessaccess.org/</u>](https://seamlessaccess.org/).
On termination of the Beta trial of the Service, directions in
respect of the continuation of the Service or its cessation
will be given, it being contemplated that there may be one of
the following outcomes in respect of any or all of the
Advanced, Standard and Limited versions of the Service:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">        
5.1.1. continuation of the Service with the Service as integrated and with a revision of the Terms of Service under clause 12 (which revision will provide new terms relating to the termination of the Service); or
</p>
