# Beta Statistics Guide

As part of the Beta Phase for SeamlessAccess, Service Providers at any level of integration are asked to collect various statistics to help us understand whether SeamlessAccess is being successful at improving the federated authentication workflow for users. This should be provided monthly; aggregated statistics from all SPs will be published on the SeamlessAccess.org website.

## KPIs
1. Click rate on the Seamless Access Call To Action (CTA)  - the button
  * Metric = number of times CTA is clicked on/number of times CTA is displayed (impressions)
  * Provided to SeamlessAccess as a Monthly average across all customers
  * Comparable click rate for equivalent CTA prior to SeamlessAccess implementation is also requested.
2. Completion rate for Federated Authentication journey
  * Metric = number of times a session is successfully authenticated via Federated Authentication / number of times the Seamless Access CTA is clicked on
  * Provided to SeamlessAccess as a Monthly average across all customers
  * Comparable completion rate for equivalent journey prior to SeamlessAccess implementation is also requested.
3. SAML-based authentication as a % of all institutional authentication methods  
  * Metric - number of sessions institutionally authenticated via Federated Authentication/total number of institutionally authenticated sessions
  * Provided to SeamlessAccess as a Monthly average across all customers
  * Comparable completion rate for equivalent journey prior to SeamlessAccess implementation is also requested.

## UI/UX information
* SPs are asked to share any quantitative and/or qualitative user research they conduct during the beta period, provided no confidential information is disclosed.
